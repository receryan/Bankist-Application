# Bankist-Application
Basic application simulating real online banking operations

This application was developed interactively with online instructor Jonas Schmedtmann through his course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Hero" on Udemy. The application is used to teach some important concepts regarding the inplementation of JavaScript functionality to HTML/CSS documents, the adding and altering to these documents to achieve a certain end goal, DOM manipulation, and so on.

This application simulates some of the simple functions of a generic online banking application. Some of these primary functions included thus far are: logging in via a username/password combination, logging deposits and withdrawals, transferring money between other Bankist accounts, closing an account, requesting loans, and so on. This application has not yet been fully developed and so some functionalities are yet to be implemented. To see the entirety of the application, the user would need to use a predetermined username/password combination, such as:

"Username: js"
"Password: 1111"

*It should be noted that students of the course are given base templates for the application, within which the student will make all appropriate changes and additions. Therefore, to avoid plagiarism, Jonas Schmedtmann is the rightful owner of the HTML and CSS templates used in this project.*
